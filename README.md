# HW9-README Generator  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
I created this application to generate a new README using the built-in terminal of VSCode. As a developer, I find myself making README files a lot, and thought there could be an easier way. A user can run this application and create READMEs without having to write the markdown formatting every time. They simply need to answer prompts and their README will be generated. This is a very useful tool that I find myself using for every project.

## Installation
To install this README generator, the user will need to create a clone of this repository and open it in VSCode. The user will need to have npm installed to be able to run this application in the built-in terminal.  

[For more information on installing npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install)  

The user will need to right-click on the index.js file and select "open in integrated terminal". Then run the command "npm i inquirer" to install the inquirer package. After that, run the command "node index.js" to start generating a README. 

## Usage
The user will need to follow the Installation instructions above. Then they will be prompted with several questions. The README that is generated through the application will be titled "README1.md", as to not confuse it with the other README.md that exists in the repository. Be mindful that each time this application is run, the previous data saved in "README1.md" will be overwritten. I have provided a link to a YouTube video demoing the application installation, usage, and the README that is generated.
